# The hilo game (Junhee)
Hilo game. Each player starts with 300 points. At each turn, a hilo program presents a card number from 1 to 13. The user guess if the next card drawn will be higher or lower than that. If the player guessed right, s/he gains 100 points. If guessed wrong s/he loses 75 points. A player who reaches 0 point loses.
